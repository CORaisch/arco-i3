#+TITLE: Installing Arch Linux with Arcolinux Spices
#+toc:nil

* 1) Installation of bare Arch Linux
** 1.1) download Arch Linux image from https://www.archlinux.org/download/ and put on USB
** 1.2) strictly follow steps in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide and https://arcolinuxd.com/1-how-will-we-proceed-with-the-installation-of-arch-linux/ till installation of Xorg stuff
** 1.3) /OPTIONAL/ backup-clone partitions with bare installation on extern HDD (do this once per machine)
* 2) Installation of Video Drivers (if necessary)
** 2.1) on ThinkPad no additional drivers seem to be necessary
*** 2.1.1) the required driver should be /xf86-video-intel/ for future purposes
** 2.2) on main computer the installation was not tested yet, so no further information about drivers
*** 2.2.1) since the main computer is using a Nvidia video card the proprietary Nvidia drivers should be installed
* 3) Installation of Desktop/Window Manager and Utils
** 3.1) install git
** 3.2) clone repo from arcolinuxd: https://github.com/arcolinuxd/arco-i3 into ~/Apps
** 3.3) run scripts in ~/Apps/arco-i3/ArchWay to prepare installation from arcolinux repositories
*** 3.3.1) run ~/Apps/arco-i3/ArchWay/20-trust-key-v4.sh first
**** 3.3.1.1) if script #20 comes up with an error run ~/Apps/arco-i3/ArchWay/10-add-keyservers-for-key-importing-v4.sh first and then rerun ~/Apps/arco-i3/ArchWay/20-trust-key-v4.sh
*** 3.3.2) run ~/Apps/arco-i3/ArchWay/30-add-arcolinux-repo-to-pacman-conf-v5.sh and ~/Apps/arco-i3/ArchWay/40-install-software-ArcoLinux-uses-in-bashrc-v1.sh
*** 3.3.3) /OPTIONAL/ if you want to setup autologin, additionally run ~/Apps/arco-i3/ArchWay/50-create-autologin-group-to-be-able-to-autologin-v1.sh
** 3.4) run ~/Apps/arco-i3/000-use-all-cores-makepkg-conf-v3.sh, it will optimize installation time during building packages from AUR
** 3.5) install yay and trizen as AUR helpers
*** 3.5.1) open /etc/pacman.conf and copy the 3 lines starting with /[arcolinux_repo]/
*** 3.5.2) rename the the repo name of the copy to /[arcolinux_repo_iso]/
*** 3.5.3) update pacman repos: # pacman -Syyu
*** 3.5.4) from the /arcolinux_repo_iso/ you can install yay and trizen: # pacman -S yay trizen
*** 3.5.5) remove the /arcolinux_repo_iso/ repo afterwards by simply deleting the 3 copied lines from 3.5.2
** 3.6) now install LightDM and i3 by running ~/Apps/arco-i3/100-display-manager-and-desktop-v1.sh
*** 3.6.1) add line: sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed i3lock
** 3.7) ~/Apps/arco-i3/110-install-sound-v3.sh, ~/Apps/arco-i3/120-bluetooth-v2.sh, ~/Apps/arco-i3/130-install-printers-v3.sh, ~/Apps/arco-i3/150-install-network-discovery-v4.sh, ~/Apps/arco-i3/160-install-tlp-for-laptops-v1.sh
*** 3.7.1) /IMPORTANT/ don't install ~/Apps/arco-i3/140-install-samba-v3.sh, since it can conflict with later packages (it's not needed neither)
** 3.8) run ~/Apps/arco-i3/200-software-arch-linux-repo-v2.sh to install utilities from official Arch repos
*** 3.8.1) /IMPORTANT/ there are many programmes going to be installed which you probably don't need, so go through the list and comment out those you don't want to use
*** 3.8.1) uncomment: geany, atom, gimp, inkscape, nomacs, ristretto, firefox, pragha, simplescreenrecorder, evolution
*** 3.8.2) add line: sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed thunderbird archey3 bdf-unifont network-manager-applet emacs
*** 3.8.3) add line: sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed lolcat  :P
** 3.9) run  ~/Apps/arco-i3/300-software-AUR-repo-v1.sh to install utilities from AUR (takes longest)
